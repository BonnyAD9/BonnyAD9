### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a developer who enjoys programming in statically typed programming languages. I usualy work on small utilities that make my life better
or just fun things (fractals, loopover, ...). I'm also working on several C# libraries that can help anyone using that language.

You can visit my [website](https://bonnyad9.github.io) to learn more about me.

### Languages I know
(odered by my confidence while programming)
- **C#** (my main language)
- **C** (learned it in school, prefer to use C++)
- **C++** (currently in the process of learning it more)
- **Python** (I prefer to use other languages)
- **JavaScript** (just enough to do what I need)
- **Haskell** (because I like functional programming)
- **Java** (kind of implicitly, because I know C#)
- **J** (just for fun)
- basically anything if you show me the syntax and some good practices
